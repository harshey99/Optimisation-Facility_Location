# Optimisation-Facility_Location


The facility location problem is about finding the best locations for some facilities. In our
problem, we have a list of cities, and we are going to build some supermarkets to serve the customers in
these cities. The supermarkets could be anywhere, not just at the cities, i.e. a supermarket could be near
a city or between two cities. There is no population outside the cities. Supermarkets have no limit on
capacity. We want to locate the supermarkets so as to minimise the total travel time for all customers. The
objective function is formulated in supermarket.ipynb with data in supermarket_cities_locations.csv
and supermarket_cities_populations.csv. A plotting function is included. We will implement a Random
Search approach to this problem, a Particle Swarm Optimisation approach, and a CMA Approach.
